Hello to everyone,

I developed a mobile application using riverpod as state management and following the MVC + S architecture.

The application provides access to a page that correctly verifies the email and password information received from the user and lists the participants if the login process is successful. 🚀

While logging in, I sent a request to reqres.in/, which is a fake API site. In case of successful login, I saved the incoming token to local storage using SharedPreferences. and made it accessible throughout the app using Riverpod.⚡️

Additionally, when the application is opened, the user automatically logs in if he/she has logged in before and reports an error against invalid user information during the login process. 🎨👨‍💻
